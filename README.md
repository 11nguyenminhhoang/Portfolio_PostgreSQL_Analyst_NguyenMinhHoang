SQL porfolio-Parch-and-Posey-Database

I use SQL with CTL WITH, and handle Select - Where - Order by - When Case - handle time - clauses as well as some necessary Windown Functions.

Analysis of Retention Rate (customer retention rate) over 1 year of business.
The goal is to show the decline in the number of customers over time.From there, develop strategies to drive customer demand.

In addition, I also use the file as an RFM (recency - frequency - monetary) analysis to aim at grouping - classifying customers.
Towards group analysis or finding patterns to better understand customers.
